## Description
The website is used for tracking different types of triangles. There are three triangles that are included depending on the sides of the triangle. The triangles include: Scalene triangle, Equilateral triangle and Isoceles triangle. Once the user enters the different sides of the triangle and submit the values, an alert box will appear informing the user which triangle the three values form. If a user enters invalid values such as negative values or no values at all the alert box will tell the user that that is not a triangle. If wrong values are entered then the user can reset and the user can enter correct values.
